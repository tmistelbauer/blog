It is settled, my next metal journey will be Saxon!

Oh boy, they have an extensive catalogue, I guess this will take ma a while. Nontheless, I will listen to all of their studio albums in chronological order, starting with their 1979 self titled debut Saxon .

First note: Is it just me or does #StallionsOfTheHighway have a very Motörheady vibe?

Round 2 of my #SexySaxon metal journey: we are now in 1980 and the name of the album is #WheelsOfSteel.

Still sounds very Motörheady. Or does Motörhead sound Saxony?

The doublebass near the end definitely has serious #Overkill vibes.

---

Why do the vocals in #747 sound so different? Do they have multiple singers?

You can tell that I don't know anything about Saxon 🫣

---

My #SexySaxon metal journey continues with their 2nd 1980 release #StrongArmOfTheLaw, the 3rd #Sacon album.

#HeavyMetalThunder is a banger, I can tell! 

Still has strong Motörhead vibes, I guess that will stay?

4/23 is #DenimAndLeather from 1981

#PrincessOfTheNight sounds oddly familiar. I don't have it in my #lastfm history, so I guess I must have heard it somewhere else? 🤔

Seems to me that with #DenimAndLeather Saxon changed their vibe slightly, also, it feels less Motörheady.

That's a good one BTW:

5/23 is #PowerAndTheGlory from 1983.

Seems like the Motörhead vibes are gone now and Saxon found their own style. Or is it the other way round? Let me know what you think!

I really like those deep dives. Esp. in chronological order, you can hear the evolution of the band's sound and style.

So far, I hear early #PowerMetal. You can clearly tell that Saxon had a new drummer on this record. 

A lot of the #Motörhead resemblance was actually because of the drumming, reminded me a lot of #PhilTaylor.

#Nightmare has a bit of a hair metal vibe to it 🤔 

Very interesting record so far! Maybe even the best on my #SexySaxon metal journey yet.

[Nightmare on YT Music](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=weV_x9pjiiQ)

---

6/23 on my #SexySaxon metal journey is #Crusader, released in 1984, the year I was born (so it has to be a good one).

Ooh, the title track starts niiiice!

I guess with #Crusader we are deep in Saxon's #PowerMetal phase that started with #PowerAndTheGlory? Did I get this right?

[Crusader on YT Music](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=4AdP6WtYZ9Y)

---

7/23 is #InnocenceIsNoExcuse from 1985 and it has a very different album cover compared to their other ones.

With #RockinAgain it starts very 80ish, which, of course, makes sense, given that we are in the 80s 😂 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=y4VXQDRcsZ0&feature=share

---

Yep, Saxon's #InnocenceIsNoExcuse is as 80s as its album cover.

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=xNbB1bqgd-k

---

8/23 is Saxon's 1986 release #RockTheNations

But before I start, a word on #InnocenceIsNoExcuse: I bet this one was very controversially received by their fanbase. It was fun though.

Now onto #RockTheNations. I have this weird feeling that it will suck...

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=YoALAI8h_as

---

Ok, #RockTheNations doesn't suck, but it doesn't stand out either. Feels like an add-on to #InnocenceIsNoExcuse.

But #PartyTilYouPuke is actually funny 😂 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=JSnh3ooFmIw

---

Hmmmpf... no, I didn't like #Destiny.
I can see why people might like it though.

I will continue my #SexySaxon metal journey after a short work break. I will be back with #SolidBallOfRock soon!

10/23 we fast forward 3 years and are now at Saxon's 1991 release #SolidBallOfRock.

God, I hope they changed the direction, the previous 2-3 albums were... meh.

The title track sounds very promising so far!

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=eeEXeQCMvno&feature=share

Sorry for my double postings, I screwed up my thread and had to repost everything to have it back in order 😬 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=eeEXeQCMvno

---

Oh yes, #SolidBallOfRock sounds much better compared to their mid/end 80s stuff. Looks like they needed this short break.

Are there any veteran Saxon fans in here? How did you feel about the album when it came out?

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=FtgBIX2DykE&feature=share

---

11/23 of my #SexySaxon metal journey is #ForeverFree, which continues the path taken with #SolidBallOfRock. 
Edgy, I like it 🤘 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=kjjadjwM6UE

---

Oh, I just learned that #ForeverFree was (partly) recorded in Vienna 🇦🇹 

Looks like Saxon pretty much flew under the radar in the 90s.

What a shame, #SolidBallOfRock and #ForeverFree are really fun 🤘 

---

12/23 is #DogsOfWar and I am now halfway through Saxon's huge catalogue on my #SexySaxon metal journey.

Will there be another mid-decade style change like in the 80s?

#BurningWheels sounds like a good one 🤘 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=cvywUFIb3rI

---

#SexySaxon metal journey update:

Ok, Saxon's #DogsOfWar is not bad, but it feels like they lost the momentum they gained with their previous albums.

From what I read, with Dogs Of War and their next one, #UnleashTheBeast, they reached their low point in popularity.

Let's hear why...

---

13/23 of my #SexySaxon metal journey is #UnleashTheBeast from 1997.

The intro hints a bit of a gothic theme...

The title track starts with a fine, very old-school riff 🤘 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=W97EZEe8rc4

---

While all hell is breaking loose with Saxon's #AllHellBreakingLoose on my #SexySaxon metal journey, my thoughts on #UnleashTheBeast...

This one rocks hard! Much better than its predecessor. I have no idea why it pretty much flew under the radar.

I didn't like the ballads though, but the closer is killer track!

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=mLTOhGyUOeM

---

14/23 #Metalhead marks Saxon's last record of the 20th century.

From what I learn from Wikipedia, things started to improve record sale wise... Seems like the 90s were a tough time for Saxon.

The title track #Metalhead starts off great!

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=3dvxZju0CPo

---

#SexySaxon metal journey update:

I really like that with #Metalhead Saxon got much heavier.

#PissOff for example is a great heavy tune 🤘 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=xGWj2_1Xztk

---

15/23 is Saxon's first album of the 21st century. It is called #KillingGround and was release in September 2001.

Let's see if Saxon continues their heavier path in my #SexySaxon metal journey.

The title track is killer! I hear doublebass, nice! 🤘 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=TkNU628Pf1Y

---

#SexySaxon metal journey update:

#DragonsLair is 🔥 This one goes directly into my "Heavy" playlist.

Saxon fun fact: Killing Ground was their first album that entered the French charts. Sacre bleu! 🥖 🇫🇷 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=d6p_KhY_Yhs

---

16/23 on my #SexySaxon metal journey is Saxon's 2004 release #Lionheart.

I really like what they did from #Metalhead onwards, let's see if they continue this path.

Fun fact: the title is refering to Richard the Lionheart, who was once captured in a castle in 🇦🇹 .

#nowplaying #WitchfinderGeneral, which is an absolute banger 🤘 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbo0gSqQjhw

---

17/23 now onto Saxon's 2007 release #TheInnerSanctum, wich is their first album to enter the UK album charts since 1988s #Destiny.

Slowly but surely I am approaching the later phase of Saxon, still 5 records to go in my #SexySaxon metal journey though.

Anyways, #nowplaying #NeedForSpeed

#SexySaxon metal journey update.

I'll be frank, after almost 3 days of listening exclusively to Saxon, my motivation fades a bit. Boy, they do have an extensive discography...

Anyone here to cheering me on?

Here's Attila the Hun coming for you:

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=4rxzXmXgjpY&feature=share

---

18/23 is #IntoTheLabyrinth from 2009. This is Saxon's first album that entered the Austrian charts 🇦🇹 

This is the second in a row that doesn't contain a title track... 🤔 

Can a song called "Batallions of Steel" be bad? I don't think so, so here you go:

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgCnlfUOY4

---

19/24 is a #CallToArms in my #SexySaxon metal journey!

The opener Hammer Of The Gods sure takes no prisoners, Saxon really knows how to open an album 🤘 

This one did NOT enter the French charts (come on 🇫🇷 ) after 4 consecutive entries, but ranked 18 in Germany (hell yeah 🇩🇪 ), which meant an all time high in (major) charts since 1985!

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=VHoyFCW1W1E

---

Oh, that's a good one:

#nowplaying: Saxon - Afterburner

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=prJTVP6Gik8

---

20/23 on my #SexySaxon metal journey is #Sacrifice

It starts off with a tribally intro and then BOOM 💥 

What a great title track!

#nowplaing Saxon - Sacrifice 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=MgXYLKSHKf8&feature=share

---

21/23 is Saxon's 2015 release #BatteringRam

I was supposed to see them in 2016 at this very tour, supporting #Motörhead. Well, that sadly never happened...

And what a f***ing shame that is, because Battering Ram is something else, WOW!
Honestly, I did not expect this in my #SexySexon metal journey!

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=x2aKsU3TMTE&feature=share

---

22/23 #Thunderbold from 2018 is the second to last album on my  #SexySaxon metal journey 

The last albums, espacially from Call To Arms onwards have been absolutely fantastic 🤘 

#nowplaying Saxon - Thunderbolt

#SexySaxon metal journey update:

#nowplaying They Played Rock And Roll on https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=FlhlO1U5F5c&feature=share

What a nice hommage to Lemmy and Motörhead. 🤘

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=FlhlO1U5F5c

---

23/23 Here we are, the grand finale of my #SexySaxon metal journey!

This has been a long ride, it took me 3 full days of exclusively listening to Saxon.

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=N07ArmWtQw8

#SexySaxon metal journey: Epilogue

This was intense, 23 Albums in 3 days is no joke. Esp. when you need to work too 😂 

My conlcusion: Saxon is awesome! 

How could I miss this for so long? Biff has an incredible voice!

The only albums I didn't like were the ones their "hair metal" era in the 80s.

Power & the Glory was one of my favourites, also Call To Arms and Battering Ram were absolute killers.

I guess I need some days off until I do another deep dive. 
But I will do anohter one! 🤘
