It is settled, my next #Metaljourney will be #Saxon!

Oh boy, they have an extensive catalogue, I guess this will take ma a while. Nontheless, I will listen to all of their studio albums in chronological order, starting with their 1979 self titled debut #Saxon .

First note: Is it just me or does #StallionsOfTheHighway have a very Motörheady vibe?

Round 2 of my #SexySaxon #metaljourney: we are now in 1980 and the name of the album is #WheelsOfSteel.

Still sounds very Motörheady. Or does Motörhead sound Saxony?

The doublebass near the end definitely has serious #Overkill vibes.

Why do the vocals in #747 sound so different? Do they have multiple singers?

You can tell that I don't know anything about #Saxon 🫣

My #SexySaxon #Metaljourney continues with their 2nd 1980 release #StrongArmOfTheLaw, the 3rd #Sacon album.

#HeavyMetalThunder is a banger, I can tell! 

Still has strong Motörhead vibes, I guess that will stay?

4/23 is #DenimAndLeather from 1981

#PrincessOfTheNight sounds oddly familiar. I don't have it in my #lastfm history, so I guess I must have heard it somewhere else? 🤔
