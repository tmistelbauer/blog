It is settled, my next #Metaljourney will be #Saxon!

Oh boy, they have an extensive catalogue, I guess this will take ma a while. Nontheless, I will listen to all of their studio albums in chronological order, starting with their 1979 self titled debut #Saxon .

First note: Is it just me or does #StallionsOfTheHighway have a very Motörheady vibe?

Round 2 of my #SexySaxon #metaljourney: we are now in 1980 and the name of the album is #WheelsOfSteel.

Still sounds very Motörheady. Or does Motörhead sound Saxony?

The doublebass near the end definitely has serious #Overkill vibes.

Why do the vocals in #747 sound so different? Do they have multiple singers?

You can tell that I don't know anything about #Saxon 🫣

My #SexySaxon #Metaljourney continues with their 2nd 1980 release #StrongArmOfTheLaw, the 3rd #Sacon album.

#HeavyMetalThunder is a banger, I can tell! 

Still has strong Motörhead vibes, I guess that will stay?

4/23 is #DenimAndLeather from 1981

#PrincessOfTheNight sounds oddly familiar. I don't have it in my #lastfm history, so I guess I must have heard it somewhere else? 🤔

Seems to me that with #DenimAndLeather #Saxon changed their vibe slightly, also, it feels less Motörheady.

That's a good one BTW:

5/23 is #PowerAndTheGlory from 1983.

Seems like the Motörhead vibes are gone now and #Saxon found their own style. Or is it the other way round? Let me know what you think!

I really like those deep dives. Esp. in chronological order, you can hear the evolution of the band's sound and style.

So far, I hear early #PowerMetal. You can clearly tell that #Saxon had a new drummer on this record. 

A lot of the #Motörhead resemblance was actually because of the drumming, reminded me a lot of #PhilTaylor.

#Nightmare has a bit of a hair metal vibe to it 🤔 

Very interesting record so far! Maybe even the best on my #SexySaxon #Metaljourney yet.

6/23 on my #SexySaxon #Metaljourney is #Crusader, released in 1984, the year I was born (so it has to be a good one).

Ooh, the title track starts niiiice!

I guess with #Crusader we are deep in #Saxon's #PowerMetal phase that started with #PowerAndTheGlory? Did I get this right?

7/23 is #InnocenceIsNoExcuse from 1985 and it has a very different album cover compared to their other ones.

With #RockinAgain it starts very 80ish, which, of course, makes sense, given that we are in the 80s 😂 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=y4VXQDRcsZ0&feature=share

---

Yep, #Saxon's #InnocenceIsNoExcuse is as 80s as its album cover.

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=xNbB1bqgd-k

---

8/23 is #Saxon's 1986 release #RockTheNations

But before I start, a word on #InnocenceIsNoExcuse: I bet this one was very controversially received by their fanbase. It was fun though.

Now onto #RockTheNations. I have this weird feeling that it will suck...

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=YoALAI8h_as

---

Ok, #RockTheNations doesn't suck, but it doesn't stand out either. Feels like an add-on to #InnocenceIsNoExcuse.

But #PartyTilYouPuke is actually funny 😂 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=JSnh3ooFmIw

---

Hmmmpf... no, I didn't like #Destiny.
I can see why people might like it though.

I will continue my #SexySaxon #Metaljourney after a short work break. I will be back with #SolidBallOfRock soon!

10/23 we fast forward 3 years and are now at #Saxon's 1991 release #SolidBallOfRock.

God, I hope they changed the direction, the previous 2-3 albums were... meh.

The title track sounds very promising so far!

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=eeEXeQCMvno&feature=share

Sorry for my double postings, I screwed up my thread and had to repost everything to have it back in order 😬 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=eeEXeQCMvno

---

Oh yes, #SolidBallOfRock sounds much better compared to their mid/end 80s stuff. Looks like they needed this short break.

Are there any veteran #Saxon fans in here? How did you feel about the album when it came out?

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=FtgBIX2DykE&feature=share

---

11/23 of my #SexySaxon #Metaljourney is #ForeverFree, which continues the path taken with #SolidBallOfRock. 
Edgy, I like it 🤘 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=kjjadjwM6UE

---

Oh, I just learned that #ForeverFree was (partly) recorded in Vienna 🇦🇹 

Looks like #Saxon pretty much flew under the radar in the 90s.

What a shame, #SolidBallOfRock and #ForeverFree are really fun 🤘 

---

12/23 is #DogsOfWar and I am now halfway through #Saxon's huge catalogue on my #SexySaxon #Metaljourney.

Will there be another mid-decade style change like in the 80s?

#BurningWheels sounds like a good one 🤘 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=cvywUFIb3rI

#SexySaxon #Metaljourney update:

Ok, #Saxon's #DogsOfWar is not bad, but it feels like they lost the momentum they gained with their previous albums.

From what I read, with Dogs Of War and their next one, #UnleashTheBeast, they reached their low point in popularity.

Let's hear why...

---

13/23 of my #SexySaxon #Metaljourney is #UnleashTheBeast from 1997.

The intro hints a bit of a gothic theme...

The title track starts with a fine, very old-school riff 🤘 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=W97EZEe8rc4

---

While all hell is breaking loose with #Saxon's #AllHellBreakingLoose on my #SexySaxon #Metaljourney, my thoughts on #UnleashTheBeast...

This one rocks hard! Much better than its predecessor. I have no idea why it pretty much flew under the radar.

I didn't like the ballads though, but the closer is killer track!
